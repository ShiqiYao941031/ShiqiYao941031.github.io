description: In this post, we will briefly discuss the commonly used description towards the spatial random field. Some basic principle relates to spatial geostatistics will also be included. 
In this post Lie groups are regarded as a differential manifold, and one-parameter subgroups are introduced. This is the second of a series of posts that start from Lie group and Lie algebra, where I try to understand "infinitesimal operators" and "generators" used by physicists from a mathematical standpoint.

The Geostatistics method always rely on some assumption towards the random field.
